  "description": "This program will process and import boundary relations from a OSM PBF file. The process is optimized for rendering - instead of building (multi)polygons, boundary relation way members are imported as unconnected linestrings allowing different segments of a single boundary to be styled independently. This also avoids overlapping lines where different boundaries and admin levels meet, and allows renderers like Mapnik to draw dashed lines correctly.",
